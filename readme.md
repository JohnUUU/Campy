# Brown Hackathon 2023: Campy
Inspiration
When we were kids, the campfire was a place to tell stories and share what was happening in our lives. In much the same way, we wanted to encapsulate that feeling online to create a platform to share stories with others.

### What it does
Campy is a web-app that lets users share stories and ideas through small-sized voice chats. One functionality that makes Campy unique is the ability for users to listen in on conversations without needing to join the group.

### How we built it
We used Javascript, Agorra SDK, HTML, and CSS to create the webapp. We used Figma to design our workup.

### Challenges we ran into
Formatting was a major challenge. Finding a good voice chat library to use was also challenging and took a lot of switching around.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud for finishing the project!

### What we learned
We learned a lot about how to use voice chat libraries and integrating it with javascript onto a frontend.

### What's next for Campy
We're developing new features that will allow you to see how many visitors are listening in before clicking on a campfire. We also want to implement live transcription for those who are hearing impaired.
